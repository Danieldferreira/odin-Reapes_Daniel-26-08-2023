    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The chopped jalapeno adds the perfect amount of flavor to this delicious cornbread muffin recipe! Combined with the subtle sweetness of honey and brown sugar, these easy cornbread muffins make a wonderful fridge and garnish.</p>
    <p>It's been about 24 hours since my last cornbread muffin. My stomach craves. My day seems incomplete. It's the scattered jalapenos. And honey and melted butter. The sweet and spicy. It's all so good.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter , plus more for greasing muffin tins</li>
    <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>1/4 cup minced jalapeño, seeded and white membranes removed, plus 12 thin slices</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>1 cup plain yellow cornmeal</li>
    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon taco seasoning, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and grease the cups of a 12-muffin tin</li>
    <li>Place 1/4 cup butter in a small skillet and melt. When butter is melted, add onion and minced jalapeño and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine beaten eggs and buttermilk, stirring briskly to combine.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, taco seasoning, salt, and baking soda.</li>
    <li>When the onions and jalapeños have cooled to room temperature, combine with egg and buttermilk mixture, stirring briskly</li>
    <li>Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients, stirring until dry ingredients are just moistened and there are no lumps. Pour batter evenly into prepared muffin cups. Place a slice of jalapeño on top of each muffin.</li>
    <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle of the muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. If it does not come out clean, bake about 5 minutes more and test again</li>
    <li>Cool in the pan on a rack, about 5 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
