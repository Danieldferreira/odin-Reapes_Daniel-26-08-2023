    <h1>Cuban Ropa vieja</h1>
    <img src="../Img/Cuban ropa vieja.webp" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>tells the story of a poor old man who had nothing to feed his family, so he went and looked in his closets for all the old rags he found, frayed them and made a stew with that. A divinity appeared to him and granted him the miracle of turning the shreds of his rags into meat and, according to what they say, this is the reason why it bears the name "Old Clothes."</p>
    <p>However, it was not until a wave of emigrants from the Canary Islands imported this dish to the Americas, specifically to those countries that touch the Caribbean Sea. This is why we find that the dish is preferred in countries like Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, and Mexico, but especially Cuba, as it still maintains its original name.</p>
